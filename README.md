# Remaining problems 

The size of the app is still large. Performance is not optimized best. Some part of the code could be refractorred better.  
> It is also worth mentioning that the app is built in a 72-hour hackathon*.  
*It doesn't meet production quality yet, hence will never be available on Play Store.*
